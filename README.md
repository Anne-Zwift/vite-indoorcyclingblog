# üì¶ My Indoor Cycling Blog
vite-indoorcyclingblog
School project

## üåüHighlights of this Project
- The Front-end will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on their own posts.
- Features such as following/unfollow users, commenting on posts, and reacting to a post with an emoji.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èOverview
This is a Front-end for a social media application, it is a single-page application (SPA) with Vite and vanilla TypeScript.
A separate Project Plan includes details about the steps of this project.
### The pages included are:

- Login page.
- Register page.
- Post/feed page.
- Individual post page.
- User's own profile page.

### Out of Scope:
The importance of this assignment is to demonstrate JavaScript. Therefore, there will not be an amazing design for the project, just some basic styling in place.

## System Architecture:
### Backend Context
The backend server is hosted externally and is not part of this repository. All API requests are from the client directed to the base Url defined in `src/constants.ts`.
The application follows a Three-Tier Monolithic architecture by connecting to a remote, unified Node.js/Express API backend by PostgreSQL. This repository contains only the client-side code.

### Component Breakdown:
#### Browser(Client): 
The Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Vite and TypeScript. It communicates with the server via API calls.
#### Server(Monolith): 
A single external Node.js/Express application that hosts all business logic (Auth, Posts, Routing) and serves the API endpoints.
#### Database(PostgreSQL): 
The external persistent data store used by Server.

## üíª Technologies
